# Password Reset with Code - Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

### Backend Changes:
1. **Updated User Model** - Added new fields:
   - `passwordResetCode`: Stores the 6-digit verification code
   - `passwordResetCodeExpires`: Expiration time for the code (10 minutes)

2. **New Email Service Function**:
   - `sendPasswordResetCodeEmail()`: Sends a 6-digit code instead of a link
   - Code expires in 10 minutes for better security

3. **Updated Controllers**:
   - `forgotPassword()`: Now generates and sends a 6-digit code
   - `resetPassword()`: Now accepts email, code, and new password

### Frontend Changes:
1. **New Component**: `ResetPasswordWithCode.jsx`
   - Accepts email, 6-digit verification code, and new password
   - Auto-formats code input (numbers only, 6 digits max)
   - Better user experience with clear validation

2. **Updated ForgotPassword**: 
   - Now shows "Code Sent!" instead of "Email Sent!"
   - Redirects to reset password page with email pre-filled
   - Updated messaging to reflect code-based system

3. **Updated API**: 
   - `resetPassword()` now sends `{ email, code, password }`

## Benefits of Code-Based System:

1. **Email Delivery**: Gmail and other email clients don't block verification codes
2. **Better UX**: Users can easily copy/paste or type 6-digit codes
3. **Security**: Shorter expiration time (10 minutes vs 1 hour)
4. **Mobile Friendly**: No need to switch between email app and browser
5. **Reliability**: No issues with localhost URLs or link formatting

## How to Test:

1. Go to `/forgot-password`
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for the 6-digit code
4. Click "Enter Verification Code" or go to `/reset-password`
5. Enter your email, the 6-digit code, and new password
6. Submit to reset your password

## Next Steps for Production:

1. Update `FRONTEND_URL` in backend `.env` to your production domain
2. Consider adding rate limiting for password reset requests
3. Add logging for security monitoring
4. Consider SMS backup for critical accounts

The code-based system should resolve the Gmail link loading issue completely!

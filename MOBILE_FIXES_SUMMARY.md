# Mobile Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Settings Page - Logout Button Hidden on Mobile
**Problem**: The logout section in settings was not visible on mobile due to insufficient bottom padding.
**Solution**: 
- Added `pb-20 lg:pb-6` to the main container to provide space for mobile bottom navigation
- Ensured proper scrolling with adequate bottom padding

### 2. Chat Page - Message Input Not Working
**Problem**: The message input field and send button were not accessible on mobile due to layout height conflicts.
**Solutions**:
- Modified Layout component to detect chat pages and apply appropriate overflow settings
- Added `overflow-hidden` for chat pages and `overflow-y-auto` for other pages
- Fixed ChatPage height calculations by removing fixed viewport heights
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to message input container to prevent it from being compressed
- Enhanced input field with proper mobile styling:
  - Added `fontSize: '16px'` to prevent iOS zoom
  - Added `touch-target` class for proper touch interaction
  - Enhanced send button and image upload button with proper touch targets (`min-w-[44px] min-h-[44px]`)

### 3. Desktop Navbar - Icons Not in Top Right
**Problem**: Navigation icons (notification, avatar, logout) were not properly positioned in the top right on desktop.
**Solution**:
- Added empty flex spacer for desktop layout
- Ensured icons are always positioned on the right with `ml-auto`
- Improved avatar with clickable link to edit profile
- Added fallback avatar with user initials
